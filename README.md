# weilSieDichLieben
_Configure your own personal BVG Anzeigetafel and enjoy public transport again!_

## Intro
I had this idea the other day that I wanted my own personal BVG Anzeigetafel in the entrance area of my flat, where I see the live departure times for the stations I'm interested in. It should look somewhat nice, and I wanted to run it on any old tablet. Thats why I created weilSieDichLieben.

## Getting started
Just visit www.weilSieDichLieben.de with any browser, configure your stations and you're good to go. On iOS/iPad OS you can also add the page to the Homescreen via the "Share" Button, which gives you this nice fullscreen mode as seen on the pictures below.

## Notes
Please note that the Website may look odd on small devices, as it was primarily made for a tablet located in my entrance area. You have to try it out.

The WebApp is far from perfect, but I thought i already share this with you in its current state, as it may already help someone. And maybe you have cool ideas that may help with the development.
